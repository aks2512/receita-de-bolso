# Project AI Notes — Agents & Tooling

This file documents the testing and CI scaffolding that agent runs and contributors should follow.

## Expo reminder

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing any code targeting Expo features.

## Testing

- Test runner: `jest` with `jest-expo` preset.
- Assertion + DOM: `@testing-library/react-native` and `@testing-library/jest-native`.
- Renderer: `react-test-renderer@19.1.0` (must match `react` `19.1.0`).

Run tests locally:

```
yarn install
yarn test
```

Mocks added for tests (see `__mocks__/`):

- `fileMock.js` — static asset stub
- `expo-router.tsx`, `expo-image.tsx` — lightweight component mocks
- `react-native-native-modules.js` — minimal NativeModules mock
- `async-storage.js` — in-memory AsyncStorage mock
- Additional mocks created for form tests:
  - `expo-image-picker.tsx` — image picker mocks
  - `expo-sqlite.js` — lightweight sqlite mock used by `drizzle-orm/expo-sqlite`
  - `react-native-keyboard-controller.js` — provides `KeyboardAvoidingView` stub

## Tests added

- `src/components/forms/recipe-form.test.tsx` — covers validation, add/remove ingredient and step inputs, and submit behavior with mocked create/update request hooks.
- `styleMock.js` — CSS mock

## Recent UI additions

- `src/components/forms/config-form.tsx` — added language select for `pt` / `en` and wired translation support to `src/i18n`.

## Test guidance and Drizzle note

- Prefer mocking request hooks instead of the DB driver in unit tests: mock `@/requests/create-recipe` and `@/requests/update-recipe` to return stubbed `useCreateRecipe` / `useUpdateRecipe` implementations. This avoids invoking `drizzle-orm` + `expo-sqlite` internals during unit tests.- For localized button labels, use stable `testID` selectors in tests so the suite does not break when translation text changes.- If a deeper integration test is required, either supply a full `expo-sqlite` mock that implements the synchronous calls `drizzle` expects, or run integration tests against a real SQLite instance.

## Linting / devDependencies

- CI runs `yarn lint` via `expo lint`. To run ESLint locally with TypeScript/React rules, install these devDependencies if not present:

```text
yarn add -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-native
```

Adding a basic `.eslintrc.json` helps reduce CI noise; ask me to add one and I will create it with recommended rules for this project.

## Continuous Integration

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Runs on: `push` and `pull_request` to `master`
- Steps: checkout, install, `yarn lint`, `yarn test`

## Notes for AI agents

- When adding tests that import assets via the `@/assets/*` alias, ensure moduleNameMapper in `jest.config.js` includes `^@/assets/(.*)$` mapping to `/assets/`.
- If tests require native modules, add a focused mock under `__mocks__/` and map it in `jest.config.js`.

## Quick checklist for contributors

- Run `yarn install` after pulling changes.
- Run `yarn test` and `yarn lint` locally before pushing.
